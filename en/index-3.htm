                                             to our students, but through our colleges and research centers we help to create new
                                             knowledge such as working on developing new treatments for cancer, producing new technology
                                             for addressing the world’s energy needs and developing new techniques for increasing
                                             the global food supply.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Adriaan De Man was born in the Flemish region of Belgium, and grew up in Portugal.
                                       He is a proud former student of Coimbra university, an institution with medieval roots
                                       and rich traditions, where he started developing a passion for archaeology that would
                                       ultimately lead him to Al Ain. He currently is Associate Professor and serves as Chair
                                       of the Department of History and Archaeology. He directed twenty-one archaeological
                                       excavations, mainly at Roman and early Islamic sites, and published almost one hundred
                                       texts, including five books. From time to time, he also explores other periods; he
                                       is now dealing with Bronze Age materials from recent fieldwork, and on the other hand
                                       with the Portuguese presence in the Arabian Gulf.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Over the years, different paths led him to Art History, Museum Studies and Cultural
                                       Tourism, in the private sector as well as in academia. Part of his academic career
                                       has been centered on research evaluation and quality assessment for governments and
                                       funding agencies in Europe and North America. Together with the regular attendance
                                       of scientific conferences, these evaluations are crucial for keeping up with the latest
                                       developments in Higher Education, whilst at the same time giving back to the research
                                       community. Adriaan lives a happy life in Al Ain with his wife and his almost three
                                       years old daughter. Most of his free time is spent with them. He very recently joined
                                       the local rugby club, in a reminiscence of his early student days, when he played
                                       for Académica de Coimbra. He is also a UAE Automobile and Touring Club marshal, and
                                       is writing these lines during an interval of the 2018 Abu Dhabi Formula One Grand
                                       Prix, at which he is deployed to the pit lane. &nbsp;

                                    <p>Prof. Sulaiman hasbeen working on the development of liquid biofuels since 2004.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>He explains, “It all started after completing my PhD, in Biochemical Engineering from
                                       the University of Malaya, in 2003. My PhD thesis was on the kinetics of enzymatic
                                       hydrolysis of vegetable oils. The enzyme used for oil hydrolysis is the very one used
                                       for oil transesterification in biodiesel production. Therefore, it was just a matter
                                       of time before I was drawn into the biodiesel research. Working with enzymes has also
                                       introduced me to bioethanol (another liquid biofuel) production from lignocellulosic
                                       biomass.”&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>He began studying the kinetics of enzymatic reaction of straight vegetable oils, and
                                       his first publication in this field was back in 2006, just before joining UAEU. Since
                                       then, his research has focused on using waste biomass, such as waste cooking oils
                                       and animal fats for biodiesel production, and lignocelluloses for bioethanol production.&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>In 2010, he started working with microalgae, which have proved to be good source of
                                       oils with several favorable features. Above all, these microorganisms are capable
                                       of growing in saline water, which reduces the freshwater loading, and their cultivation
                                       does not require agricultural land development. Prof. Sulaiman and his team developed
                                       an enzymatic pretreatment process for effective&nbsp;oils extraction from wet microalgae
                                       biomass, without the need for drying. The team also studied the oil extraction and
                                       reaction using supercritical <span>CO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub>. The team was able to enhance the oils content in microalgae by several folds by
                                       media manipulation,&nbsp;and developed a technique for simultaneous extraction-reaction
                                       system from wet biomass.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Concurrently with biodiesel production, the team&nbsp;used microalgae for <span>CO</span><sub>2</sub><span>&nbsp;</span>removal from flue gas, and for industrial wastewater treatment. They also developed
                                       a novel process of&nbsp;using microalgae to regenerate amine solutions saturated with <span>CO</span><sub><span>2&nbsp;</span></sub>that comes out from a conventional gas sweetening absorption unit.&nbsp;

                                    <p>As a result of his obsession with&nbsp;enhancing&nbsp;oil content in the microalgae, he came
                                       to realize that the proteins, which have been suppressed in favor of enhancing the
                                       oils, could be&nbsp;more valuable than the oils which led him to start work on protein&nbsp;extraction
                                       and testing for antioxidant and antitumor activities.

                                       passionate about. He has published 75 journal papers to date, and authored a book
                                       and three book chapter on biofuels. He was also granted a US Patent on using&nbsp;supercritical&nbsp;<span>CO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub>&nbsp;in&nbsp;biodiesel production.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">To make a positive impact on someone's life; values, dedication, opinion and productivity
                                       are the key! With these words, Dr. Synan AbuQamar climbed the academic ladder to become
                                       an Associate Professor at the Department of Biology in the United Arab Emirates University
                                       (UAEU) since 2014. Dr. AbuQamar completed his Ph.D. from Department of Botany &amp; Plant
                                       Pathology/Purdue University in 2007. Following his Ph.D., Synan pursued as a postdoctoral
                                       fellow in the laboratory of Prof. Tesfaye Mengiste at Purdue University.&nbsp;In 2008,
                                       he joined the Department of Biology at UAEU as an Assistant Professor.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Since then at UAEU, Synan has established a Plant Molecular Genetics/Plant Biotechnology
                                       laboratory at the Department of Biology. His current research area is Molecular Genetics
                                       of Plant Immunity. His research focuses on understanding the molecular and cellular
                                       factors that control plant defense mechanisms against necrotrophic pathogens – pathogens
                                       that kill host tissues/cells to complete their life cycle- using “model” and “crop”
                                       host plants. As a translational scientist, Dr. AbuQamar has been able to take forward
                                       his basic research using genomics, transcriptomics and gene functional approaches
                                       to agricultural and field applications, and back to the lab to know more about basic
                                       science. The ultimate goal is to substantially reduce the devastating impact of diseases
                                       on plants.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In the UAE, as in other countries in the world, plants fight to survive harsh environmental
                                       stresses, including plant pathogens. Synan is <em>striving&nbsp;</em>to improve plant resistance to pathogens/diseases. Traditional horticultural and chemical
                                       practices have proven their limitations, or even negative impacts on the environment
                                       and human health. Therefore, genetic engineering and biological control can limit
                                       the increases of pathogen populations, and often suppress the plant tissue destroying
                                       activities of pathogens. In his lab, Synan has extensively been concerned about the
                                       plant-microbe interaction, including <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>-<em>Botrytis</em> <em>cinerea</em>, date palm-<em>Thielaviopsis</em> <em>punctulata&nbsp; </em>and&nbsp;mango-<em>Lasiodiplodia</em> <em>theobromae&nbsp;</em> pathosystems. For example, <em>B. cinerea&nbsp; </em>is considered the second most important fungal pathogen worldwide that causes diseases
                                       in a wide range of crops. <em>T. punctulata</em> and&nbsp;<em>L. theobromae</em> causing black scorch disease (locally known as Medjnoon) on date palm and dieback
                                       disease on mango; respectively, negatively affect the agribusiness in the UAE.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr. AbuQamar’s lab has efficiently limit chemicals use on plants. So far, the lab
                                       has generated several mutations in genes and discovered many biocontrol agents for
                                       a highly effective solution against these “nasty” fungi. All research findings are
                                       the result of research projects carried out by Dr. AbuQamar’s team including M.Sc.
                                       and Ph.D. students. Synan has published over 50 publications in highly impact international
                                       journals. This is evident that American Society of Plant Biologist (ASPB) has recognized
                                       Synan being one of the most highly cited author in “Plant Cell” and “Plant Physiology”
                                       journals published between 2009-2013 in the Middle East and Africa. In addition, he
                                       has been recognized in several occasions by UAEU as a “distinguished researcher” with
                                       publication in top ranked journals. In 2017, he was awarded the College of Science
                                       Award for Excellence in Scholarship.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Professor Basel Al-Ramadi first encountered immunology during his undergraduate studies
                                       at Edinburgh University some 30 years ago. At that time, immunology as a medical discipline
                                       was still going through a formative process. Despite the relative immaturity of immunology,
                                       Professor Al-Ramadi was fascinated by the intricacies and potential impact of immunology
                                       on disease. He decided to pursue a postgraduate degree in the subject. It was a fortunate
                                       decision as he was then closely involved with the revolution in immunology that took
                                       place. Following his Ph.D at Temple University School of Medicine, he joined the laboratory
                                       of Professor Charles Janeway Jr. at Yale University, as a postdoctoral fellow. This
                                       shaped Professor Al-Ramadi’s career as the Department of Immuno-biology at Yale was
                                       arguably one of the most influential immunology departments in the world. For the
                                       next seven years he was fortunate to work alongside 200 immunologists and witness
                                       many exciting discoveries in the field.&nbsp; &nbsp;

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">After Yale, Professor Al-Ramadi’s arrival at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences
                                       at the United Arab Emirates University twenty years ago represented a huge challenge
                                       and an even bigger opportunity. The challenge was to continue working in a highly
                                       competitive field at a relatively young institution. The opportunity was to utilize
                                       his experience to develop immunological research in the UAE. The record shows that
                                       this has been a success. The CMHS cooperates with Tawam Hospital and other international
                                       immunologists in order to further studies in immunology. Their first breakthrough
                                       was double-blind, controlled clinical trials. They also established a strong translational
                                       cancer immunology research program in the CMHS. Along the way, partnerships have been
                                       forged with colleagues from Yale University, Harvard University, Institut Pasteur,
                                       the University of São Paulo, New York University and the University of Vermont.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The research focus in Professor Al-Ramadi’s laboratory is on how the immune system
                                       can be modulated to the benefit of the host in diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity
                                       and microbial infections. These investigations have received more than AED 4 million
                                       in grants, which has helped to train more than 30 MSc./Ph.D students, immunology fellows
                                       and undergraduate medical students. They have also published nearly 80 articles in
                                       top scientific journals. These include the Journal of Immunology; the Journal of Allergy
                                       and Clinical Immunology; Frontiers in Immunology; Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy;

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>In July 2015 Iltaf Shah became an Assistant Professor of the College of Science at
                                          the United Arab Emirates University. His research focuses on the development of chemical
                                          tools to better understand the role of vitamins and metabolites in the human body.
                                          He is particularly interested in vitamin D targets and narrow-spectrum therapeutics.
                                          As part of this research, he recently developed an innovative vitamin D test to measure
                                          vitamin D deficiency in the Emirati population. In collaboration with Tawam Hospital
                                          Medical School, Dr. Shah is also seeking to commercialize this test by implementing
                                          it in UAE hospitals. He has also worked with Kingston University to develop a new
                                          test that detects kidney disease at an early stage in humans.</span></p>

                                          mass spectrometry instruments. He has recently developed a test used for doping control
                                          in camel racing. This is a joint effort between Dr David Cowan’s laboratory at Kings
                                          College London and the Camel Forensic Laboratory in Al Ain. After significant news
                                          coverage in the UAE, Iltaf has been asked to record an interview with ITV news in

                                          Naughton at Kingston and then followed this with a lectureship at the same University.
                                          He then moved to UAE to take up a post as an Assistant Professor of Biochemistry at
                                          UAEU. His graduate, Ph.D and postdoctoral work was mainly on the bioanalytical aspects
                                          of small molecules in human bodily fluids. He has also investigated the use of specialised

                                    <p><strong>Promoting growth, inclusiveness and intergenerational wellbeing</strong></p>
                                    
                                    <p>Professor Nihel Chabrak believes we should be looking at new approaches to promote
                                       growth alongside social welfare. Development should consider not only the here and
                                       now, but how generations to come will be able to shape their future lives.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Professor Chabrak works in the Accounting Department of the College of Business and
                                       Economics at the United Arab Emirates University. She is researching how to promote
                                       economic connections between macro objectives, such as sustainability, and yet still
                                       create more micro incentives for the growth of businesses. In cooperation with colleagues
                                       from other well-known international research institutions, she is working on reforming
                                       finance, governance and accounting in order to support growth. Growth is about wellbeing
                                       as well as development. It is not only measured by GDP but by the dispersion, composition
                                       and sustainability of that growth. Policy makers should aim for an inclusiveness that
                                       allows people to transform their lives.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Economic growth is an important determinant of wellbeing but it is not the only one.
                                       Social and ecological factors are also important indicators of wellbeing, and in some
                                       cases, are directly related to it. Countries should pursue sustainable growth so that
                                       future generations can enjoy the same level of prosperity as now. Therefore, we should
                                       maintain our productive base across generations. This includes human, health and natural
                                       capital. According to Professor Chabrak, it is the concept of shareholder value maximization
                                       that has aggressively degraded natural capital and created inequalities in the economy
                                       and wider society. “An economic framework should reshape corporate behavior to support
                                       sustainable growth, which is the real wealth of nations.”

                                       UAEU Science and Innovation Park, where she is promoting value-driven startups and
                                       encouraging businesses that are more inclusive and sustainable. Among the startups
                                       in the incubation program is Green Steps Energy. This is a UAE startup company founded
                                       by four female engineering entrepreneurs. Their vision is to establish a citizenship
                                       movement for a greener planet. They have designed an energy generating carpet (called
                                       Bezeo) that transforms kinetic energy into electrical energy. Another startup she
                                       helped with is Aroma Niche. This is an eco-friendly aromatherapy product which uses
                                       plants native to the UAE and Gulf region. This helps to preserve local heritage while
                                       offering a unique product.

                                       Chabrak is interested in researching the links between entrepreneurship and wellbeing.
                                       With her colleague, Dr. Chafik Bouhaddioui, she has developed a long-term research
                                       project using data from the GEM program. The purpose of this research is to examine
                                       the potential relationship between entrepreneurship and happiness in the UAE in order
                                       to help policy makers evaluate entrepreneurship as a measure of wellbeing and to encourage
                                       further growth.

                                       and wellbeing of students. As a strong advocate for providing innovative avenues along

                                       in academic program development, he established the UAE’s first structured joint psychiatry

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Having served as its first faculty director for six years, he saw this program grow
                                       to the point where, in 2010, it branched out into three initiatives in different emirates,
                                       and was pivotal to its accreditation by the US-based Accreditation Council for Graduate
                                       Medical Education. During this time, Dr Osman was chosen to chair the Arab Board of
                                       Psychiatry Committee on curriculum development, credentialing and accreditation, and
                                       continues to perform a vital liaison function.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, he co-founded the Higher Professional Diploma Program in Psychological
                                       Skills and Competencies in Mental Health, a collaboration between CMHS and the National
                                       Rehabilitation Center in Abu Dhabi. Since its establishment, it has graduated more
                                       than 60 mental health professionals – most of them UAEU alumni – who are now based
                                       at major hospitals around the UAE.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">And Dr Osman’s wealth of experience has led to him playing a key role in development
                                       mental health treatment guidelines for primary care physicians in Abu Dhabi, and in
                                       providing training activities that enable this roadmap to be implemented. He has also
                                       been a significant contributor to Continuing Medical Education programs in the UAE
                                       and abroad, and regularly organizes and presents at regional and international psychiatric
                                       and neuroscience conferences.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Osman is certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, is a Life
                                       Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, and is licensed as a consultant psychiatrist
                                       at Al Ain and Tawam Hospitals.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In his spare time, he likes to play squash, table tennis, swim and to travel across
                                       the globe.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Many people talk about mapping out their career. For Dr Naeema Al Hosani, that takes
                                       on a more literal meaning.

                                       drawing maps, and now brings that knowledge to UAEU students as Chair of its Department
                                       of Geography and Urban Planning. But her role within the university – and within UAE
                                       life – has a much&nbsp;wider compass.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Since arriving at UAEU, she has been heavily involved in scholarship, teaching, and
                                       service, in addition to holding senior administrative positions at departmental, collegial,
                                       and university level, including chairing and being a member of numerous committees.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Her professional life has two aspects. On the research side, she has a high-caliber

                                       in top-ranking Western academic journals and her experience and insight seeing her
                                       make presentations at domestic, regional, and international conferences.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Al Hosani participated in the transfer of groundbreaking Western research to an
                                       Arab audience by translating significant, globally-important books in her area of
                                       specialization. The outstanding nature of her research has led to her winning many

                                       in Research, as well as being honored by the UAEU Provost for her publication record.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In the teaching field, Dr Al Hosani has carved a reputation for reliability, resourcefulness,
                                       and dynamism, as an excellent planner and organizer, and for her dedication to creating
                                       a vibrant learning environment. Her approach is based on interactive teaching strategies,
                                       inquiry-based learning, nurturing students’ individual passions and curiosity, and
                                       integrating IT into the educational process.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Describing her role in the classroom as being “a facilitator and guide in a&nbsp;challenging
                                       adventure designed to foster collaboration, discourse and discovery”, she has played
                                       a pivotal part in curriculum development and learning outcomes assessments at UAEU.
                                       Her academic work recently led to her receiving the UAEU Award for Excellence in Teaching,
                                       2017, and the Prestigious Khalifa Award for&nbsp;distinction in teaching, recognition that

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Al Hosanis stature and expertise has seen her make a valuable impact to enriching
                                       knowledge and opportunity across UAE society. She has participated in an array of

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Her impressive community service record includes cooperation with local universities
                                       and government bodies, such as the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Youth and

                                       of the Interior.&nbsp;And she has established many cooperation initiatives aimed at strengthening
                                       connections between UAEU's academic community and wider UAE society, by establishing
                                       avenues of dialogue, outreach, and knowledge exchange.

                                    <p>&nbsp;Having published his first work on climate change in the 1990s, as a PhD student
                                       at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, he has since been involved in studies into
                                       related topics including climate variability, seasonality, phenology, changing rainfall
                                       patterns, and species decline. But since 2009, when he took up a faculty position
                                       at the University of Hong Kong, his research focus has primarily been on the vulnerability
                                       of the hotter parts of the world to climate change, and whether temperatures may already
                                       be too high for many of their species.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>&nbsp;Less than one percent of global climate change research has been conducted in the
                                       world’s tropical zone – where, as of 2014, 40% of the Earth’s population live – with
                                       the emphasis tending to be on regions where temperatures are changing more rapidly,
                                       such as in the Northern Hemisphere. However, as Dr Thomson explains: “A small temperature
                                       increase in a region which is already too hot could be much more damaging than a large
                                       temperature increase in a region which is still too cold.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>&nbsp;His team at UAEU – whose Environmental Sciences Program was the UAE’s first postgraduate
                                       Masters program - has found that many species in cooler regions are actually better
                                       served by warmer conditions, through research that crystallized data from almost 50
                                       studies on terrestrial birds. In hotter regions, however, they found many species
                                       have already reached the ‘optimal’ temperature level – where any increase immediately
                                       turns ‘perfect’ into ‘negative’.

                                    <p>In this field of research, Dr Thomson supervises a postgraduate student team, and
                                       has also involved 16 undergraduates in the last two years. Their work has featured
                                       at numerous conferences, and they have raised its profile and purpose among the UAE
                                       community through their outreach efforts.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>“In essence, this is a research program,” says Dr Thomson, “but by engaging undergraduate
                                       and postgraduate research students, it is also an active experiential education program.
                                       The students are studying something real, then taking their work out into the public
                                       domain, where they can explain to the public and to decision-makers why it is important.”&nbsp;

                                    <p>The program’s impact, and its success in promoting undergraduate research, led to
                                       Dr Thomson being recognized at UAEU’s College of Science awards ceremony in 2017.
                                       It was the latest accolade in a career that has seen him run internationally-acclaimed
                                       research programs at prestigious institutions - including the Royal Dutch Academy
                                       of Sciences and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research – win plaudits for
                                       the quality of his courses, and see his work graded ‘excellent’ in peer review. He
                                       has been published in top journals such as Nature, Proceedings of the Royal Society,

                                    <p>Dr Thomson takes this work beyond the laboratory, too. As a respected thought-leader
                                       and influencer on climate change, he participates in climate summits, contributes
                                       to media discussions, government working groups, and consultations, and is regularly
                                       invited to directly address leaders in the field of climate change.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Diving has always been a defining element of Professor Chris Howarth’s life – in fact,
                                       it was what first brought him to the UAE three decades ago.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">These days, however, he dives into the depths of research, rather than oceans – research
                                       which aims to unlock new discoveries surrounding critical health issues.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Now based in the Department of Physiology of the College of Medicine and Health Sciences
                                       at United Arab Emirates University, Chris amassed an entirely different set of life
                                       experiences before entering academia and science. His previous career was in the commercial
                                       diving industry, where he spent much of the 1980s after completing his training in
                                       the UK coastal town of Plymouth, and which gave him his initial taste of life in the
                                       Middle East.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Having taken up a role as a manager for a commercial diving company in Abu Dhabi,
                                       Chris became well acquainted with life beneath the waves in the offshore oilfields
                                       of the Arabian Gulf. However, toward the end of the 1980s, he decided the time was
                                       right for a career change, returning to his home country of the UK and obtaining a
                                       Bachelor of Science degree, with first-class honors, in physiology and biochemistry,
                                       a PhD in Cardiac Physiology (supported by a Prize Studentship from the British Heart
                                       Foundation), and two postdocs from the University of Bristol and the University of
                                       Leeds.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">And his relationship with the UAE was rekindled in 1998 when he took up the position
                                       of Assistant Professor in UAEU’s Department of Physiology, being promoted to Associate
                                       Professor in 2003 and Professor in 2008, while also serving as the Chair of the Department
                                       from 2012-2016.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">For more than 15 years, a key focus of Chris’ laboratory has been understanding the
                                       cellular basis of electrical and mechanical defects in the diabetic heart. This focus
                                       has two strands: the effect of diabetes on the generation and conduction of electrical
                                       signals; and the effect of the disease on cardiac muscle function.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The heart’s electrical and mechanical function is often compromised by diabetes -
                                       one of the most serious national, regional, and global health issues, estimated to
                                       affect 415 million adults in 2015, and predicted to affect 642 million by 2040. Over
                                       a million diabetes cases were reported in the UAE in 2015, and cardiovascular disease
                                       represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with the condition.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The research that Chris and his lab have conducted in the field of diabetes has led
                                       to collaborations with a string of international universities, including the University
                                       of Bristol, the University of Central Lancashire, the University of Dublin, the University
                                       of Leeds, and the University of Manchester. Chris’ work has been supported by more
                                       than 40 national and international grants and generated more than 100 original articles
                                       and book chapters, while he has supervised many undergraduate and postgraduate MSc
                                       and PhD student projects.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The robotics and media laboratory at United Arab Emirates University (UAEU) is where
                                       you will find Dr Jose Berengueres connecting art with state-of-the-art.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">As Assistant Professor at UAEU’s IT College, the Barcelona native with a PhD in bio-inspired
                                       robotics is seeking to bridge the supposed gap between art and technology by demonstrating
                                       how they intertwine and open up new horizons, and inspiring students to combine technical
                                       and mechanical work with allowing their imagination to flow freely.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Projects in the lab that Dr Berengueres leads are focused on four areas – art and
                                       tech, creativity research, data science research, and robotics research – and activities
                                       range from crunching numbers to encouraging recycling to building a camel-sized robot
                                       that react to students according to its mood.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">It’s a diverse environment, and one that reflects the world’s unfolding path, as Dr
                                       Berengueres, who also holds a Masters in Electrical Engineering, explains. “I believe
                                       in mixing art with technology – without doing this, you are missing out not only on
                                       a lot of fun, but a lot of meaningful research,” he says
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">“Pixar created hit movies and hundreds of highly-skilled jobs, but also pushed the
                                       technical boundaries of how computers could entertain humans. The graphic cards developed
                                       for 3D gaming have made things like the Tesla autopilot self-driving car possible.
                                       And in our lab, we are using ‘nerdy’ gaming devices for research on a new AI field
                                       called deep neural networks – because it’s the only way to do this research.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">“We have also developed the Artistic Robot, a graffiti-making robot that produces
                                       paintings in the style of Jackson Pollock and which we see as an augmented brush for
                                       artists. All of this shows how, at the IT College, we love to combine art and technology.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">This approach is also having a big, visible impact on UAEU life. Students have used
                                       360-degree cameras to showcase the campus to visitors in an innovative, immersive
                                       way, and created a “smart bin” that smiles at and thanks those using it – the result
                                       being that recycling rates soared by 300%.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">This commitment to creativity extends into Design Thinking, an increasingly popular
                                       course within and beyond UAEU. “It is a thinking framework that enables teams of people
                                       to be more creative – what we call ‘group IQ’,” said Dr Berengueres, who has taught
                                       Design Thinking and Business Models Innovation in Dubai, California, Germany, and
                                       Mexico.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">“We realized there were no really good textbooks available to teach it, so – with
                                       input from students – we published an e-book called ‘The Brown Book of Design Thinking’,
                                       one of the first textbooks tailored to undergraduate students. It led to me giving
                                       workshops around the world, and writing ‘Sketch Thinking’ [an Amazon top 100 creativity
                                       bestseller], which is used to teach how to quickly sketch ideas. We’re currently researching
                                       how the layout of meetings influences the ‘group IQ’.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The lab’s dedication to data science has seen it collaborate with Etihad on a project
                                       to predict which customers will eventually become gold members; with Singapore-based
                                       Healint LLC, maker of migraine-coping app MigraineBuddy, on a model to gauge when
                                       the condition will strike and how environmental elements such as pollution affect
                                       migraine rates; and with HappyForce, a Barcelona startup, on a tool for predicting
                                       the likelihood of employees quitting, allowing companies to address the situation.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">A specific research group has also been formed to tackle the task of making large
                                       amounts of data make sense. “Academically and professionally, this is an expanding
                                       field, for two reasons – new algorithms and faster computers,” outlined Dr Berengueres.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">“Our group helps researchers with data they do not necessarily know how to model,
                                       with the goal being to streamline computing procedures in order to conduct research
                                       faster and with more impact.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Another burgeoning global field – robotics – is also a core element of life in the
                                       lab, through its research into human-robot interaction. “It’s a mix of user experience,
                                       psychology, and robotics itself,” says Dr Berengueres.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">As part of a joint collaboration with Sendai University, we are now building something
                                       that has never been built before: a robot with a superhuman sense of touch. Imagine
                                       a robot that can tell if you have fever or malaria just by shaking your hand, for

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Professor Eric Mensah Brown is a professor of Anatomy in the College of Medicine.
                                       He was born in Kumasi, Ghana. After secondary school he attended the University of
                                       Ghana Medical School in 1980 and gained a MBChB degree. After three years medical
                                       practice with the Ministry of Health in Ghana he moved to England to undertake graduate
                                       studies at the University of Leicester. After completing a Ph.D in embryology, Eric
                                       returned to Ghana as a lecturer. He also worked as a senior lecturer at Walter Sisulu
                                       University in South Africa before joining the College of Medicine at the United Arab
                                       Emirates University in 1992 as an assistant professor of Anatomy.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">He has received best teacher award several times. His research interests include morphological
                                       studies of the camel and the houbara bustard. For the last few years Eric has worked
                                       on studying autoimmune diabetes and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE).
                                       He has presented papers at several immunology conferences and been involved with other
                                       research activities. At the moment he is a reviewer for the Kidney International,
                                       Molecular Immunology, Human Immunology and Immunology journals. He has published 50
                                       peer-refereed papers. The highlights of his studies on autoimmunity have included
                                       observations on the role of microglia as antigen presenting cells in EAE; the role
                                       of interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 and Toll-like receptor 2 pathways in experimentally induced
                                       diabetes, where interferon gamma served as a facilitator rather than an opposing factor.
                                       He has also researched the role of galectin-3 in animal models of human type 1 diabetes
                                       and multiple sclerosis. A micrograph on the role of IL-23 was used as a cover illustration
                                       for an issue of the European Journal of Immunology. In the last five years he has
                                       expanded his research interests into the epigenetic regulation of metabolic syndrome,
                                       and together with colleagues, has received several interdisciplinary and faculty grants
                                       from the university worth more than 2 million AED.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In his spare time, Dr Abdulla Al-Khatib likes to draw. When he is at the United Arab
                                       Emirates University (UAEU), his students prefer to draw on his experience and expertise.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">As Associate Professor of Civil Procedures at the UAEU, Dr Al-Khatib is focused on

                                       nation’s next wave of legal professionals, combining his academic tutelage with coordinating

                                       work in the sector – to his role of Director of the Legal Clinic at the UAEU, where

                                       as a Bachelor of Law in 2000 after four years of study, he went on to undertake his

                                       gaining a Ph.D. in Law from the Louisiana institution.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Al-Khatib cut his teeth in the legal sector by training as a lawyer at a Dubai-based
                                       firm, where he wrote memos and pleas to courts and other institutions, liaised with
                                       clients, negotiated contracts, and conducted other pivotal official matters. But the
                                       pull of academia brought him back to the UAEU, where – after publishing many legal
                                       articles in high-ranking academic journals – he was promoted from Assistant Professor
                                       to Associate Professor in 2016, his personal career highlight to date.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Since returning to the UAEU, he has been awarded the university’s Dean’s Award for

                                       in many international conferences on the topic of refugees and refugee law and has
                                       been invited to take part in panel discussions on the rights of refugees in certain
                                       parts of the world.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Jinan has volunteered in refugee camps in Jordan and Greece. While her basic foundation
                                       is in International Law, her work is multidisciplinary. She is interested in people,
                                       particularly in how to increase the visibility of groups not generally recognized
                                       under existing legal or political categories. She seeks to challenge these traditional

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">She adds that for her Ph.D thesis she, “interviewed displaced people who were not
                                       recognized legally as ‘refugees’, even though they had suffered the same displacement
                                       as refugees and were unable to return home. Their lack or recognition essentially
                                       ‘erased’ their narrative as displaced people.”

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Her current work focuses on how to better international refugee law to cope with many
                                       current challenges: such as a large influx of refugees that is not adequately covered
                                       by the 1951 Refugee Convention. Her paper for an upcoming international conference
                                       in the US focuses on faith-based principles as a regional standard to encourage states
                                       to do more to support refugee communities.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In her free time she likes to relax in coffee shops wherever her travels happen to

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">“Working with the students. That’s the best part of the job,” explains Dr. Karim El-Basyouny,
                                       speaking about his position as associate professor in the University of Alberta’s
                                       (UofA) Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. “Knowing that at some point
                                       in their graduate studies, I helped them discover their true passion and professional
                                       identity that will shape their future career.” And his dedication to his work is evident
                                       by the achievements of both himself and his students in the field of transportation
                                       engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">An authoritative researcher, respected member of UofA faculty, the inaugural City
                                       of Edmonton Research Chair in Urban Traffic Safety, and a founding member of the Centre
                                       for Smart Transportation, surprisingly, Karim did not intend to become an academic
                                       when he began his Bachelor’s degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering at United
                                       Arab Emirates University (UAEU). “Coming into the university I never thought of myself
                                       as someone with a future in academia,” he explains, and instead he intended to go
                                       into the work force after graduation. But his success as an undergraduate produced
                                       unexpected opportunities. “The university changed my outlook. It was studying, interacting
                                       with the professors, and achieving academic success that gave me the motivation to
                                       pursue graduate studies.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In 2003, after graduating from UAEU with distinction, Karim spent time working as
                                       a university research assistant, investigating the environmental regulations, impact
                                       on health and environment, and available methods for calculating fugitive dust externalities,
                                       before moving onto graduate studies. Unbeknownst to him at the time, aspects of this
                                       work were preparing him, in part, for his eventual career. “The research process especially
                                       paper and grant writing were things that came naturally to me because I had a lot
                                       of training,” he says, speaking of both his time at UAEU and his professors with respect
                                       and appreciation. “I think having access to those individuals, and their expertise
                                       really helped.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In 2004, Karim moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to begin a Masters of
                                       Applied Science and subsequent doctoral degree at the University of British Columbia
                                       (UBC). He attributes his time at UAEU for affecting this decision. “The UAE is known
                                       for its cultural diversity, which I was exposed to at a very young age. While searching
                                       for places to conduct my postgraduate degree, I wanted to continue living in a country
                                       that offered the same type of cultural acceptance. That led to my decision to study
                                       and subsequently live in Canada.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">And although graduate studies alone bring their own difficulties, moving from the
                                       United Arab Emirates to Canada—away from his family and community—introduced an additional
                                       set of complications. “I think there is always a challenge associated with moving
                                       to a new place. So moving to Canada and pursing a graduate degree away from my family
                                       was something that took getting used to, but once I adjusted I found that my transition
                                       was seamless,” he explains. “The UAE is very multicultural. Coming to Canada it felt
                                       almost the same. Growing up in the UAE, I was used to living in a diverse community
                                       with people from different backgrounds. And I felt that was something that really
                                       helped.” But going to a new place, with a foreign culture is always challenging, and
                                       some students—even those whose academics put them at the top of their classes— sometimes
                                       cannot get past these challenges.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Karim describes his first six to seven months alone, “trying to meet people, along
                                       with studying and taking graduate courses. It was a tough start. But I think … going
                                       back to the culture of the UAE, and the fact that I’ve always been around international
                                       students from everywhere around the world, even at the university. That really helped.”
                                       His resilience and perseverance paid off and in 2011 he graduated from UBC with a
                                       Ph.D. “And even despite that, I never thought I would be an academic,” Karim laughs.
                                       So, as originally planned, he went into the workforce, which brought more relocation:
                                       a move to Alberta to work with the City of Edmonton. A complex role, it called on
                                       much of the knowledge he had acquired throughout his years of study, including the
                                       solid foundation he attributes to those first years at the UAEU.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">It was after almost a year of working with the city that Karim began to realize he
                                       preferred the kind of freedom that comes with a career as an academic, “More control
                                       over my time. And more control to work on projects that interested me.” And it was
                                       around then that he joined the University of Alberta as a member of the faculty. “The
                                       first year was me trying to figure my way through the job. There was a lot to learn”
                                       he describes with a relaxed sureness. But in time, the work he was putting in became
                                       evident as the number of students registering in transportation classes began to rise
                                       from an average of 20-30 to 40-50. And around 2017 he was promoted to associate professor
                                       and given tenure. “It’s been a very rewarding journey working with the people. Launching
                                       careers of individuals. Either in the Masters or though PhDs. Seeing them get hired
                                       the in industry, or with the government. I draw a lot of inspiration from that.” He
                                       pauses a moment, “And my colleagues. They are wonderful people to be around. The environment
                                       is very healthy. We all get along and have very high regard for each other.” Karim
                                       also compares this to his time in undergraduate studies. “That is another thing I
                                       noticed about the UAEU. They were a solid and cohesive faculty.”&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Despite his achievements, Karim has at least one more milestone to reach in the foreseeable
                                       future, “Getting to professorship. Once I’m past professorship, it might be a good
                                       time to reevaluate and see where things are going to go.” Karim sees the core work
                                       he does as a professor for the university continuing—working with the students and
                                       his colleagues, and publishing papers. But he also recognizes a distinct place for
                                       his research in practical applications. “Not everybody gets a chance to do work that
                                       can have an applied appeal to it. I feel this is something I might be interested in
                                       pursuing in the future.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">When asked if he had a piece of advice for current and future students, he emphasized
                                       the value of the relationships, “The Engineering Faculty members at UAEU are among
                                       the world's most talented academics. They come from diverse backgrounds and they are
                                       graduates of some of the top engineering schools in the world. Getting to know the
                                       professors helped remove that imaginary student/teacher boundary that resulted in
                                       long-term friendships while kick-starting my graduate degree. It was through my professors
                                       that I made contacts in both US and Canadian Universities that facilitated my transition
                                       to start my post-graduate degrees.”

                                    <h4><strong>Engineer by Day &amp; Researcher by Night</strong></h4>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Shewkar Elbassiouni Ibrahim graduated with the highest honours from the Civil Engineering
                                       Department at United Arab Emirates University (UAEU) in 2008. “I remember my days
                                       at the UAEU very fondly,” says Shewkar. It was an excellent start for her both academically,
                                       and professionally. While she attributes her success to many different factors, the
                                       UAEU played an important role. From the level of education and training she received
                                       to the very advanced facilities that were available at the UAEU, Shewkar is very proud
                                       of her alma mater.&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">When she was pursuing her undergraduate degree, Shewkar took a few courses in the
                                       field of Transportation Engineering, and that is when she discovered her passion for
                                       this field. What piqued her interest was how much room there was for innovation and
                                       creativity in Transportation Engineering. This became even more evident when she completed
                                       her internship at the Roadway, Transportation, Traffic &amp; Safety Research Center under
                                       Prof. Yasser Hawas’s supervision. “If you think about it, we all participate in the
                                       road network because we either walk, drive or bike to get to work or to return home,”
                                       says Shewkar, “for this reason, we need to ensure that this road network is safe for
                                       everyone.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">After graduating from UAEU in 2008, Shewkar moved to Vancouver, British Columbia,
                                       Canada to pursue her Master of Applied Science degree in traffic safety at the University
                                       of British Columbia (UBC). Shewkar did remarkably well in all of her classes and is
                                       grateful to her professors at her alma mater for having prepared her for this new
                                       step. “The level of education that we receive at the UAEU is world class,” says Shewkar.
                                       The faculty is very well-trained and holds degrees from the best universities in the
                                       world; they also continue to contribute through the research they conduct at UAEU
                                       as well as continue to mould the new generation of graduates to help prepare them
                                       for life after university.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">After graduating and obtaining her MASc, Shewkar moved to Edmonton, Alberta, to work
                                       as a Speed Management Analyst at the City of Edmonton’s Office of Traffic Safety.
                                       This was one of the only municipal offices that targets and focuses on traffic safety
                                       at the time and she was excited to get started! Soon after, Shewkar moved into a new
                                       role as a Traffic Safety Engineer where she focused on improving safety in the areas
                                       of speed management, traffic engineering, transportation planning, as well as geometric
                                       design. During this time, Shewkar then decided to pursue her Doctor of Philosophy
                                       degree in the same field (i.e., traffic safety). “I thought it was important that
                                       research is conducted with the industry’s need in mind,” says Shewkar. She clarifies:
                                       “it’s essential that the outcome of this research actually helps benefit road safety
                                       agencies specifically, and societies overall.” Even though she was warned about the
                                       challenges of working and studying simultaneously, Shewkar decided to embark on this
                                       journey anyway. “Engineer by day and researcher by night is how I often refer to this
                                       stage of my career,” says Shewkar while laughing.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In 2014, Shewkar started working on the City of Edmonton’s Vision Zero Road Safety
                                       Strategy. Vision Zero is the goal of eliminating all fatalities and serious injuries
                                       as a result of a motor vehicle collisions, “it’s the noblest of goals, essentially,
                                       I am working on saving lives,” says Shewkar. She developed the strategy based on a
                                       number of different initiatives such as engineering programs, enforcement activities,
                                       education campaigns, road user behaviour, as well as new initiatives which look at
                                       using innovative approaches to improve traffic safety. “I was working late in my office
                                       one night dealing with a stubborn visual basic macro in Excel, and it reminded me
                                       of the late nights I spent working on a code that I created for my graduation project
                                       at UAEU,” says Shewkar. She continues, “I was first introduced to developing macros
                                       for processing of large datasets at UAEU, and it is a skill I continue to work on,
                                       albeit with different programming languages now.” In 2015, the City of Edmonton became
                                       the first major Canadian City of officially adopt Vision Zero, “it felt like a triumphant
                                       success, and I remember taking a deep sigh of relief,” she said.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the skillsets that she had an opportunity to practice and hone during her undergraduate
                                       degree was giving presentations. “We had to give a presentation at least once during
                                       a course at UAEU, if not multiple times,” recalls Shewkar. She remembers her professors
                                       stressing the significance of being able to communicate your message, “knowledge can
                                       only take you so far in life” but being able to eloquently share your message and
                                       deconstruct it into manageable and easy to understand pieces is instrumental. Over
                                       her career, Shewkar has given presentations at national, and international conferences.
                                       She has also given presentations to Council, Council Committees, international organizations,
                                       Lunch &amp; Learn Sessions, guest lectures as well as taught several classes at the University
                                       of Alberta.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">However, her UAEU professors also inadvertently helped Shewkar develop another skillset.
                                       “I remember when Prof. Mohsen Sherif and Dr. Ashraf Biddah asked me to emcee a one-day
                                       workshop at the UAEU,” said Shewkar. She remembers being quite nervous as she had
                                       never been a master of ceremonies before. Shewkar laughs and says: “little did I know
                                       that this was going to be the start of a new trend in my life.”&nbsp; Shewkar has participated
                                       in the organization of many conferences in the past eleven years. In 2009, while she
                                       was the president of the UBC Institute of Transportation Engineers Student Chapter,
                                       Shewkar organized one of the most successful Industry Nights. This was a conference
                                       where members of the industry were invited for a showcase by Transportation Engineering
                                       students. It was a great opportunity for the students to market themselves to their
                                       potential employers, and also a wonderful opportunity to strengthen university-industry
                                       relationships. More recently, in 2016, Shewkar emceed the International Conference
                                       on Transportation Innovation, which saw the launch of the first test-bed for connected
                                       vehicles in Canada. Shewkar was also the principal chair in organizing the 10th Annual
                                       International Conference on Urban Traffic Safety in Edmonton, Alberta in 2018. In
                                       addition to organizing and hosting this conference, Shewkar also participated in emceeing
                                       and introducing the keynote speakers who attended the conference from all around the
                                       world.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In her opinion, Shewkar thinks that a university does not only help prepare students
                                       academically for life after graduation, but it also teaches them different skills
                                       sets. Not only was the level of education superior at the UAEU, but after having studied
                                       abroad, Shewkar was impressed with how UAEU was leading in incorporating technology
                                       during the learning process. “When I first moved to Canada, one of the things that
                                       I noticed was how adept the UAEU graduates were at using technology without any concern
                                       or hesitation,” said Shewkar. As a result, the UAEU graduates are very comfortable
                                       incorporating new technology (e.g., smart boards at the time), and software into their
                                       careers, which sets them apart from the rest of the employment population. “The facilities
                                       that we had at our disposal including buildings, labs, computers and so on, are unmatched,”
                                       emphasizes Shewkar.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">When asked about her advice to graduating students, Shewkar said: “our lives are a
                                       culmination of our experiences, so take advantage of every opportunity that is made
                                       available to you.” Some people know exactly what it is they want out of life, but
                                       Shewkar says that she was not one of those people, rather, she just worked hard, applied
                                       her knowledge, kept an open mind and took advantage of all opportunities that came
                                       her way. “The most important piece of advice I can give you is to find a cause you
                                       believe in, work hard, be curious, ask questions, and the rest will take care of itself,
                                       good luck!”
                                    </p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">After working for the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) for 24 years and moving
                                       to the utilities sector, Mohammed Al Dhaheri was looking for a graduate program that
                                       was both local and of practical nature.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">With a number of PhD programs flooding the higher education market, he felt it was
                                       not the path he wished to follow. “I wanted something which will add value to what
                                       I am doing and will give me an opportunity to explore and build on my experience,”
                                       said Al Dhaheri, who was born in Al Ain. “The DBA program at the United Arab Emirates
                                       University is part time, which was a must for me, as any program abroad requires you
                                       to almost be full time.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the program’s first cohort, which graduated in May 2016, he chose to follow
                                       the DBA route, which was local, practical and part time. “I was very pleased to see
                                       this DBA offered by our national university,” he said. “I rushed to apply, and the
                                       program was so serious from the beginning. The selection, to the program itself, was
                                       thorough, and it was really quite a demanding one which needed commitment and patience,
                                       especially for a working individual.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">He was particularly pleased with the choice of topic, which he says, “makes or breaks”
                                       such a graduate research journey. “If you choose something you’re not really passionate
                                       about, or if you’re not really eager to research and it means something to you, then
                                       with the challenges one would face, you could easily find yourself quitting,” he said.
                                       “My topic was the effectiveness of EPC, which is engineering procurement construction
                                       in major projects in Abu Dhabi’s oil and gas sector from an end-user perspective.
                                       From my experience in operations at ADNOC, we were the end-users who looked after
                                       operating and maintaining these facilities.” Later on, he became Projects Director,
                                       managing projects in terms of their delivery.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">There, he attempted to test and verify the effectiveness of this type of major projects’
                                       model for the end-user. “Globally, there is always a compromise, and a push-and-pull
                                       between these two teams resembling project success and product success,” Al Dhaheri
                                       said. “The project manager wants to finish on time and save money to move to another
                                       project, but the end-user will endeavor to get best machinery and maintenance without
                                       poor access, as he is the one who will live with that. I’ve seen many cases where
                                       the end-user would try to push his cause in trying to get something modified or improved
                                       in certain parts of the project, but the project manager would insist that it’s not
                                       in the scope and would delay the project.” Such major projects take years, as technology
                                       evolves, rendering some equipment, at commissioning, almost obsolete.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">“You have to exactly know what you want in these EPC projects,” he added. “I pointed
                                       out how to deal with these issues later on.” Al Dhaheri moved to the Abu Dhabi Department
                                       of Energy, under which the Abu Dhabi Electricity and Water Authority (ADWEA) was merged.
                                       Since June 2011, he has been serving as Senior Adviser to the Undersecretary and Chairman
                                       of the Al Ain Distribution Company, which provides utility services to Al Ain. He
                                       is also the Chairman of the Independent Sewage Treatment Plant 2, where sewage from
                                       Al Ain and Abu Dhabi is treated to purify water. The program greatly helped further
                                       his profession.
                                    </p>
                                    “I am really pleased with the program,” he concluded. “The university invited me to
                                    become a member of the advisory board of the college and I am honored because this
                                    is an opportunity to loop the information we got from our experience into the program
                                    for improvements.”

                                    <p><strong>DBA programme opened new doors for prominent financial researcher</strong></p>
                                    
                                    <p>For Dr Safa Maatouq Al Mohana, the DBA programme at the United Arab Emirates University
                                       has opened a number of vital doors. The Head of Financial Projects and Compliance
                                       at the prestigious Abu Dhabi Media Company has allowed her to reach her full potential
                                       as a researcher.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>“The programme was great in that it helped set me up to address business issues through
                                       a powerful research process,” she said. “It helped me considerably in expanding my
                                       expert system and creating my educational expertise, while upgrading my examinations
                                       and presentation abilities through its extremely compact and compelling lectures.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Dr Al Mohana graduated from the programme in November 2015, running in parallel to
                                       her 19 years at the company as Head of Investment. “I believe that I selected the
                                       United Arab Emirates University to study due to the distinguished faculty members
                                       and the high-quality standard of education,” she said. “In my current job, the course
                                       was able to open doors for me to propose innovative ideas for the company. It also
                                       helped me better understand management principles and learn how to combine management
                                       practices with advanced business theories.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Dr Al Mohana, who is originally from Abu Dhabi, was especially thankful in the way
                                       the programme allowed her to develop her research, which extended through the stock
                                       markets in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, investigating the degree of integration between domestic
                                       stock markets of the UAE, and integration with global stock markets. The research
                                       came out as the first of its kind in the sector. “I was interested in the topic initially
                                       due to the importance of the financial crisis which occurred in 2008,” she explained.
                                       “It raised the importance of this kind of study, which I think is the importance of
                                       know-of techniques and studying the challenges that may occur in the coming years.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>She called the DBA programme “excellent”, as it prepares participants to address business
                                       problems through an effective research process. “I advise anyone who plans to take
                                       on post-graduate studies to enroll in the programme,” she said. “This is the best
                                       programme that helps a lot in widening your professional network and develops personal
                                       intellect and practical skills, while enhancing research and presentation skills.”

                                    <p>Although her interest in finance dates back to her early days, she never imagined
                                       she would end up in the position she is in today. “I am focusing on some areas of
                                       finance, such as financial markets,” Dr Al Mohana said. “My Master’s degree was in
                                       the same field and my thesis was on the financial market but, more specifically, to
                                       evaluate the performance of selected sectors of the Abu Dhabi market using financial
                                       techniques.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>She feels the skills and qualifications she acquired have now surpassed her current
                                       position. “I have to move to another dynamic environment,” she said. “I want to utilise
                                       my skills, my knowledge and my competencies. Ultimately, I would like to become a
                                       minister related to finance and economics – nothing is impossible, we just have to
                                       pray and God will help us.”

                                    <p>When Nadia Al Jaberi graduated from the DBA program at the United Arab Emirates University
                                       (UAEU) in April this year, her goal was to improve organizational learning in the
                                       field of healthcare.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Ms Al Jaberi has been working in strategic planning at the Abu Dhabi Health Authority
                                       (SEHA) for the past nine years, including seven years at Al Ain Hospital and two years
                                       at Tawam Hospital. She became interested in the program as it related to applied business.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>“It’s not like a PhD,” she said. “It was more related to my work and more beneficial
                                       to my career. The main idea of doing a doctorate thesis is that you discover a practical
                                       problem in your workplace, and you do research and align it with literature, before
                                       merging it with the academic and the managerial or practical application.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>In her case, the research was focused on the impact of leadership styles on organizational
                                       learning. The context of her research was healthcare entities under the Abu Dhabi
                                       Health Authority (SEHA) in the Al Ain region, more specifically Al Ain Hospital, Tawan
                                       Hospital and the Ambulatory healthcare services. “The result of the research provided
                                       a lot of managerial implications for my employer, which is healthcare,” she said.
                                       “In the last 15 years, the Health Authority – Abu Dhabi has seen a rapid change in
                                       terms of their leadership and management, which caused a lot of learning frustration
                                       between employees, as everyone had different strategies. So my aim was to find the
                                       strategies to improve organizational learning, even if leadership styles change –
                                       we need to find a direction for this change.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Having already acquired both a Bachelor degree and an MBA at UAEU in business management,
                                       she chose the DBA path for practical purposes and career improvement. “My research
                                       objective was to find an effective framework showing the impact of leadership styles
                                       on organizational learning through aligning the individual level with the organization’s
                                       level,” Ms Al Jaberi said.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>“We have a template to do any research – you need to start with an idea and have literature,
                                       so the most difficult part was to align my idea and work problem with strong literature.
                                       Even if you have an idea, you need literature to build on this work.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>After pinpointing a number of ideas, she discovered that organizational learning was
                                       too wide a definition. “Having one set of organizational learning is so difficult,”
                                       she explained. “The most difficult part was to narrow down my idea and to have a strong
                                       basis of literature review related to our governmental strategy and the career problem
                                       that I found. When I narrowed down my problem, I successfully found a strong basis
                                       of literature and proposed my research hypothesis.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>When she first started out her career at the Health Authority – Abu Dhabi, she never
                                       imagined she would reach such a high level later on. “I was in charge of the outpatient
                                       clinic at Al Ain Hospital and, seven years later, I decided that I needed to change
                                       my career path,” she said. “So I transferred to the Strategic Planning and Performance
                                       Management Section at Tawam Hospital two years ago because I saw it was more of a
                                       corporate level and you can see the big picture of all operations, strategies, clinical,
                                       human resources, and everything. It helped me a lot in my research.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Her ultimate goal is to help in changing some of the strategies from the perspective
                                       of decision-makers, human resource and policy-makers, in terms of initiating strategies
                                       to improve organizational learning, and having effective leadership as well as academics.
                                       “I just started giving a part-time lecture to improve my academic skills,” Ms Al Jaberi
                                       said. “At my job, they have trainers from within the employees, so I am preparing
                                       material regarding management change effect or impact, and I can give any subject
                                       related to business management because it’s my major.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>She also plans to work on an extension of her research with one of her DBA colleagues.
                                       “I would highly recommend this program, especially for the senior level and leaders,
                                       because it broadens their mind and strengthens their decision-making skills and analytical
                                       skills,” she said. “It also improves their personality in a way that they become more
                                       analytical, wiser, and display more critical thinking.”

                                    <p>Dr Yousif Alobaidli is one the most prominent figures in cultural tourism in the UAE.
                                       As the General Director of the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Centre in Abu Dhabi and the
                                       Director General of the Founder’s Memorial for the late Sheikh Zayed, founding father
                                       of the UAE, Dr Alobaidli has been working arduously to put his country’s culture on
                                       the global map.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>“We want to have a unique example by presenting tourism in the UAE, which has a very
                                       unique cultural aspect that will distinguish Abu Dhabi and the country in general
                                       from other destinations,” he said. “By focusing on this and enhancing cultural tourism,
                                       the economy of Abu Dhabi and the UAE will be further diversified and enhanced.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>HE Dr Alobaidli, who was born in Abu Dhabi, found his passion during his Doctorate
                                       of Business Administration (DBA) at the United Arab Emirates University. His five
                                       years’ studying covered a variety of topics, from business administration and innovation,
                                       to change management, human resource investment and corporate social responsibility.
                                       That laid the foundation for his thesis on cultural tourism in the UAE, with a focus
                                       on hiring and retaining Emiratis as tour guides. “The UAE and Abu Dhabi, in particular,
                                       is focusing on this sector,” he said. “With Saadiyat Island being developed as a Cultural
                                       District in Abu Dhabi, it now hosts the Louvre Museum and many other projects are
                                       in the pipeline. This will add to the existing assets, such as the Sheikh Zayed Grand
                                       Mosque, one of the most popular attractions in the world, which was nominated second
                                       best landmark in the world according to TripAdvisor in 2017.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>His time at the university, from which he graduated in November 2017, proved vital
                                       in supporting his role in this sector. “The programme is very well renowned, especially
                                       in the UAE,” he said. “It has a very high standard and the DBA is very practical as
                                       it covers almost all topics in Business. What’s good about it is that, when you conduct
                                       your thesis, it has to relate to something practical, so you’re tackling a practical
                                       issue within your field.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>He said that helped improve not only his academic side, but it also helped develop
                                       in him a deeper understanding of the field he specialised in. “Personally, I have
                                       an interest in matters related to culture and my background is related to developing
                                       new organisations, particularly businesses that focus on cultural tourism and visitor
                                       experience,” said Dr Alobaidli. “It’s important to keep the UAE’s culture alive.”

                                    <p>Upon his graduation, he further delved into the field, managing crucial cultural destinations
                                       across Abu Dhabi, under the umbrella of the Ministry of Presidential Affairs. “Thanks
                                       to my specialisation in managing cultural tourism entities, and my study with a focus
                                       on engaging Emiratis to participate and contribute to this important sector and make
                                       it more sustainable, my contribution and my study helped me enhance this aspect,”
                                       he said. “We’ve achieved great progress in this regard and are going to achieve more.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>His main drive is to build a model for managing cultural tourism that is sustainable
                                       and utilises national assets, as well as Emirati human resources, which will help
                                       in turn to diversify the UAE’s economy away from the oil sector. This is aligned with
                                       Abu Dhabi’s 2030 Vision. “It’s really important because, for the UAE to have a more
                                       sustainable income and future, it has to diversify its economy and utlise all national
                                       assets, including Emirati youth,” he added. “One of the most significant elements
                                       globally, based on WTTC, shows that tourism is the largest sector that hires people,
                                       creates jobs and it is one of the sectors that has a great effect on other sectors
                                       of the economy, including transportation, travel and the hospitality industry. This
                                       sector is expected to grow faster than the wider economy and many other industries
                                       over the next decade and it is anticipated to support over 370 million jobs by 2016.”

                                    <p>He said the UAE had the necessary assets to invest in tourism, in particular in cultural
                                       tourism. “My job is to help put the UAE on the global map,” he said. “The country
                                       has so much to offer and it’s time for people around the world to pay closer attention
                                       to that – this sector will truly be a game-changer in the future.”&nbsp;

                                       UAEU, and describes receiving his Bachelor’s degree as one of the highlights of his

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">“The time of my graduation from the university was the happiest time,” recalled Dr
                                       Al Hammadi, who was invited by UAEU to participate in the College of Sharia &amp; Law’s
                                       2017 graduation&nbsp;ceremony as an example to students of how their&nbsp;education at the Al

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">"I consider the UAEU's Faculty of Sharia &amp; Law to be the source from which I gained
                                       my knowledge and understanding of the sciences of the legal system. My time at the
                                       university helped&nbsp;me to build my legal capability, and provided me&nbsp;with guidance in
                                       my future.<br> “It helped me to determine which occupation best suits me, and that led me to my

                                       proud of.”

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to his Bachelor’s Degree from UAEU, Dr Al Hammadi's educational achievements
                                       include a Master’s Degree in International Law from Australia's La Trobe University,
                                       a Doctorate in&nbsp;Philosophy in Private Law from the University&nbsp;of Sharjah, a Higher
                                       Diploma in Legal and Judicial Sciences, and a Diploma in Criminal Sciences from the
                                       Dubai Police Academy. He continues&nbsp;to participate in many workshops, conferences,
                                       symposia, and specialized and general&nbsp;training courses.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">"I am very proud to have been a prosecutor since 2002, and the progression I have
                                       made along my career path,” he said.&nbsp;“This has led me to occupying my current position
                                       in the technical office of the Attorney General in the unit of International Judicial
                                       Cooperation, which is designed to look into various&nbsp;international requests in the

                                       assistance requests. “This is all thanks to the help I have received from higher leadership,
                                       my directors, and my colleagues, and their trust they have placed in me, as well as
                                       my own efforts. That is what I&nbsp;consider to be my biggest achievement.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">As an alumnus of UAEU, Dr Al Hammadi maintains a strong relationship and association
                                       with the university that has played such a key role in his life to this day. And he
                                       has advice, and a&nbsp;message, for its current students. “Always have faith in Allah,
                                       trust yourself, and trust others,” he says. “This is the biggest incentive and motivation
                                       for you to achieve what you seek, and what is sought from you. "Whoever strives for
                                       the top, desires excellence, and seeks success has to work hard. They will only achieve
                                       their goals through perseverance and tireless effort.”

                                       Dr. Amer Sharif never realised he would continue his studies at the flagship institution
                                       for two decades - from Bachelor of Medicine student to a&nbsp;PhD graduate - all the while
                                       helping put his country on the map for healthcare.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">As the CEO of the education sector within the Dubai Healthcare City Authority (DHCA),
                                       which oversees the development of the Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Beginning his studies in medicine, Dr Sharif said when it came to selecting a university
                                       in which to pursue his studies, the answer was an easy one. “UAEU is a model organisation
                                       and it is the model university for the nation,” he said. “So it was an absolute honour
                                       just to be accepted as a medical student. I spent eight years in Al Ain and it was
                                       the best moments of my&nbsp;life. "Myself and my fellow students were lucky because we
                                       were at the new faculty building for the College Of Medicine and Health Sciences -
                                       we were the first batch who used that facility.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">After finishing his Medical Degree from the College of Medicine and Health Sciences
                                       (CMHS) from the University, Dr Sharif became a teaching assistant in medical education
                                       at the UAEU.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">“I was the first UAEU national who was a teaching assistant in medical education,”
                                       he explained, before he made the move back to the emirate of Dubai where he has since
                                       enjoyed&nbsp;a stellar career at the helm of many government healthcare departments. But
                                       his affiliation with the UAEU continued.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">“I was a student of the UAEU until last year, so you can consider me a student from
                                       1996 until 2016 when I completed my Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) in Mapping the UAE
                                       Health System: Challenges and Recommendations from the&nbsp;UAE - which I started in 2010,”
                                       he said. "I was the first student to graduate from the medical school in the UAEU
                                       and to do a PhD in the medical school. I maintained a relationship with UAEU through
                                       alumni and through&nbsp;participating in many of the events and programmes and I was also
                                       excited to become the first general co-ordinator for alumni of the College of Medicine
                                       and Health Sciences."
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Sharif said his long affiliation with the university is one he holds close to his
                                       heart. “Every moment I spent at the university was a special one,” he said. “It was
                                       not just the studies but activities outside studies too. I was part of the medical
                                       students association, so we got involved in sporting and social activities. It felt
                                       like&nbsp;a home away from home. It has been 20 years of exciting moments."
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">During those 20 years, his career has flourished. Having also completed a Master of
                                       Science (MSc) in Healthcare Management from the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland
                                       (RCSI), in 2005 Dr Sharif began working for the Dubai Health&nbsp;Authority, joining the
                                       office of the Assistant Director General.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">“It was a big learning experience for me,” said Dr Sharif, explaining he had moved
                                       from a teaching role to a more management position. “I was going into a role that
                                       helped oversee the whole (healthcare) position."
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Sharif went onto hold many more titles at the healthcare authority, including Director
                                       of Human Resources and Director of Healthcare Operations at the DHA, while he was
                                       also involved in helping establish several key projects in the&nbsp;Dubai medical sector.
                                       Ultimately, he became the CEO of the Education Sector at Dubai Health City Authority,
                                       while also securing the role of Vice Chancellor of the Mohammed Bin Rashid University&nbsp;of
                                       Medicine and Health Sciences, which he describes a “like a dream come true”.&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">“It has always been a dream to help create and develop a healthy workforce of the
                                       future and develop an integrated academic health system that acts as an umbrella that
                                       will network with healthcare providers, with researchers, and with&nbsp;healthcare professionals
                                       across the system,” he said. “Establishing a new medical university in Dubai is something
                                       you won’t get often in your lifetime, so I think this has been the highlight of my
                                       career until now and I am very grateful to&nbsp;the leadership of the country and to the
                                       UAEU - who have given me all the skills and knowledge to be in this place today. If
                                       it was not for the UAEU I would not be in this place.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Given his long affiliation with the university, when asked if he had any words of
                                       wisdom for any current students, Dr Sharif said: “Know that every day is a significant
                                       learning opportunity. Work hard, be respectfully ambitious, learn&nbsp;from others and
                                       create connections from day one. As much as you can, collaborate with colleagues and
                                       benchmark yourself with others and learn from others. And I think the UAEU gives a
                                       great platform to do that.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Sharif credits Sheikh Zayed, the UAE’s founding father, as his main inspiration
                                       and role model throughout his successful career.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">“In this country we are inspired by our rulers,” he said. “Sheikh Zayed was a very
                                       visionary person; if it was not for him and the wise leaders who came together with
                                       him to establish the country we would not be in this situation we are in&nbsp;today. We
                                       are leading the world today in certain areas - that is credit to the visionary leadership

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">A chance meeting with a medical student at the United Arab Emirates University (UAEU)
                                       put Dr. Khalid Alnaqbi on a path to a career that led him to head Abu Dhabi’s busiest
                                       department for patients suffering from inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatic diseases.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike many students who decided to be doctors at an early age,&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Alnaqbi decided
                                       to train in the medical field only two years before studying at the UAE&nbsp;University’s
                                       College of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences (CMHS).
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">"I originally wanted to be a mechanical engineer&nbsp;or a nuclear physicist but while
                                       I was in high school I lived in Al Ain city for a week with my friend who was a medical
                                       student at&nbsp;the CMHS,” he explained. "I saw what would be my future life at the university
                                       and became thrilled to walk on this pathway.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr&nbsp;Alnaqbi&nbsp;retains fond memories of his seven-year spell at the UAEU campus, and describes
                                       receiving his doctorate as one of the highlights of his life.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">"I had a good time living the life of a medical student at the UAEU,” he recalled.
                                       "The best moment was in my seventh year when we were at&nbsp;the College of Medicine waiting
                                       for the results of the final exam.&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">"The Dean came out of the meeting room and shook hands with each of&nbsp;us saying ‘congratulation
                                       doctor!’. “At that moment, I felt I was the king of the world! I called my mother
                                       and we both cried out of joy.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr&nbsp;Alnaqbi credits the faculty at the UAE’s flagship university for steering him on
                                       the successful career path he has enjoyed to date.&nbsp;"At the University we had excellent
                                       professors who were role models and encouraged us to advance the wheel of knowledge
                                       by participating in research,” he explained. "I&nbsp;also was moved by the passion of the
                                       professors of internal medicine.”
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">It was his mentors at the UAEU who inspired&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Alnaqbi&nbsp;to make the 11,000km one-way
                                       trip to Canada to embark on a ten-year post-graduate educational journey to further
                                       his studies and knowledge.&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The doctor completed a residency training in internal medicine and&nbsp;rheumatology -
                                       followed by a fellowship in Spondyloarthritis - at the University of Toronto. He also
                                       obtained Master of&nbsp;Clinical Epidemiology and became the only Emirati to complete the
                                       Clinician Investigator Program accredited by the Royal College of&nbsp;Physicians and Surgeons
                                       of Canada.

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">After a decade in Canada, Dr&nbsp;Alnaqbi decided to return to his home country to share
                                       the knowledge he had learned and began work as a Consultant Rheumatologist at Al Ain&nbsp;Hospital,
                                       climbing the career path to&nbsp;become the Head of Department and&nbsp;Clinical Assistant Professor.
                                       His day-to-day activities now include patient care in the clinics, infusion day care,
                                       ward&nbsp;consultations, teaching post-graduate trainees and administrative work.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to highlights in his career, Dr&nbsp;Alnaqbi has many achievements under
                                       his belt, including establishing the infrastructure for the Rheumatology department.
                                       This entailed establishing sub-specialty clinics (Early Arthritis Clinic, Connective
                                       Tissue Disease Clinic, and Spondylitis Clinic), establishing Infusion Day Care, developing
                                       new clinical guidelines for rheumatic diseases and policies on handling infusion drugs
                                       for health care workers (rheumatologists, nurses, pharmacists). Dr&nbsp;Alnaqbi was also
                                       responsible for developing the Nursing Manual for Rheumatology Department and new
                                       patient educational pamphlets.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Not only content in enjoying his own career success, Dr&nbsp;Alnaqbi is committed to passing
                                       on the beacon of knowledge to other young medical students.&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">“I developed undergraduate and post-graduate curricula for family residents and internal
                                       residents, obtaining&nbsp;mannequins for teaching injections for soft tissues and joints,”
                                       he explained. "Despite limited manpower, I have spent a lot of my personal time to
                                       achieve this. Now, we are currently the most productive rheumatology&nbsp;department in
                                       the&nbsp;Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (SEHA)."
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to those who have inspired him the most in his working career,&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Alnaqbi
                                       looks to his own family tree as a motivational force. "I have been inspired by my
                                       parents for their hard work and support in raising us and ensuring that we succeed
                                       in our lives,” he said. "I lost my&nbsp;mother recently but her inspiration has given me
                                       strength to overcome many life challenges."
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">As an alumnus of UAEU, Dr Alnaqbi credits the university for playing such a key role
                                       in his life and he has advice, and a message, for its current students. If you had
                                       to give any words of wisdom to current students at the UAEU what would it be? "Love
                                       what you do because it will self-motivate you to be better at it,” he said. "Life
                                       has many challenges, and it is up to you to decide how you react to these challenges.&nbsp;
                                       "Just believe in yourself."
                                    </p>
